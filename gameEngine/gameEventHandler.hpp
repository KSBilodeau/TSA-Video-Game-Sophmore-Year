/*
    This class maintains the storage and "triggering" of in-game events (actual event processing
    is handled by more specialized classes like textbox handler)
 
    Think of this as a hub between the gameObjects and the game's predefined events:
    ( "=>" indicates a passing of data to another class)
 
    Player collides with a specific tile =>
    Map detects the collision and discovers an event ID linked to it =>
    GameEventHandler finds a textbox sequence event with that id so it sends it to it
    specialized processing class =>
    Textbox handler triggers the displaying of a specific series of textboxes as indicated by
    the event id
